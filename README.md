# VBA-Challenge
For this project I created a VBA scripts in excel macros to analyze quaterly stock prices. The script that I created analyzed the quaterly change, percentage change, and total volume of every stock throughout four quarters. It also shows the stocks with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and the greatest total volume in every quarter.
The four image files show the results of my script. You can find the excel files that I ran this script through in the starter_code file. The Vba scipt I used is in the "Vba Scipt.bas" file.

To effectively analyze the data, I looped through the worksheets using "For Each ws In Worksheets". I used many important functions to analyze the data, including "WorksheetFunction.Max", "WorksheetFunction.Min", and "WorksheetFunction.Match".

I had help from my instructor named Luna Zhang, who helped my finish my code for this project.
